I created this project alone as part of the front-end curriculum at [The Turing School](http://turing.io). This was my first foray into learning React.js, and I learned a lot! I also implemented a previous project of mine, [a prefix tree](http://github.com/katiescruggs/complete-me), to do the autocomplete functionality when the user types a city in. The weather data comes from the [wunderground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs).

Technologies used: React, API calls, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Enzyme, Jest, Git, GitHub
